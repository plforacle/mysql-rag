# Introduction

## About this Workshop

Welcome to this comprehensive workshop on creating an AI-powered film information retrieval system! In this guide, you'll learn how to build a sophisticated chatbot that combines the power of large language models with MySQL's vector capabilities to deliver accurate, contextually relevant information about films.You will build a modern information retrieval system combining traditional databases with cutting-edge AI capabilities. By the end of this session, you'll understand how to create your own Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems using familiar LAMP stack technologies.

### What We'll Cover 

FilmRAG represents a significant shift in how we think about database applications. Instead of simply storing and retrieving exact matches, this application understands the meaning behind user queries and returns semantically relevant information.

Imagine a user asking "What are some good movies for a rainy Sunday afternoon?" A traditional database would struggle with this query, but FilmRAG can interpret the intent and provide contextually appropriate recommendations.

In  our workshop, we'll:

1. **Create the User Experience**: Develop a responsive chat interface for natural interaction
2. **Explore the RAG Architecture**: Understand how Retrieval Augmented Generation works and why it's transforming information retrieval
3. **Examine Vector Embeddings**: Learn how text is converted into mathematical representations that capture meaning
4. **Implement MySQL Vector Functions**: See how MySQL Enterprise Edition supports vector operations without specialized databases
5. **Build the Integration Layer**: Connect database retrieval with language models 


### Why This Matters

In today's information-rich environment, users expect systems to understand their intent, not just their exact words. Traditional keyword-based search is being rapidly replaced by semantic search that understands meaning.

FilmRAG demonstrates:
- How to leverage existing database investments for AI applications
- Creating factually grounded responses that avoid hallucinations
- Building conversational interfaces to structured data
- Implementing vector search without complex infrastructure

### Workshop Format

This will be hands-on! We'll be:
- Walking through the codebase component by component
- Making modifications to understand core concepts
- Testing different query types and observing the results
- Discussing implementation strategies for your own projects

### What You Need

To follow along, you should have:
- A basic understanding of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)
- Familiarity with API calls and JSON processing
- A curious mind and questions ready

### The Big Picture

What makes FilmRAG special is that it bridges the gap between traditional database applications and modern AI capabilities. We're not replacing databases with AI - we're enhancing databases with semantic understanding while maintaining their reliability and specificity.

By the end of this workshop, you'll understand how to implement these same principles in your own domain, whether that's e-commerce product search, knowledge base enhancements, or content recommendation systems.

Let's get started by examining the core components of our application and how they work together to create an intelligent film information system!

_Estimated Workshop Time:_ 90 minutes
